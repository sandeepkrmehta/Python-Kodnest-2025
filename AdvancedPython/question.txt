    1. What is access modifiers and how many types we have in python?

    -> access modifiers  are used to determine the accessibility of methods and properties.

    2. Types:

    -> public : a

    -> protected : _a
 
    ->Private : __a

    3. Explain Public Access Modifiers/Specifiers:
    
    -> We can Access public methods or properties inside the same class in which they are 
    decleared, outside the class, inside the child class, inside no-child class.

    Code Example: 

    4. Explain Protected Accessibility in Python:

    -> We can Access public methods or properties inside the same class in which they are 
    decleared, outside the class, inside the child class, inside no-child class.

    Python won't support protected Access Modifiersits just a message from developer to developer to access the variables
